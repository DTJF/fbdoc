Welcome to the *fb-doc* package. It's a cross-platform
multifunctional tool, mainly for generating documentation from and for
FreeBASIC (= FB) source code, but useful for other purposes as well,
ie. like generating header files. Rather than creating the
documentation output directly, *fb-doc* is designed to close the
gap between FB and C syntax to allow for using any C / C++
documentation tool-chain. Also it supports the creation of
documentational comments in the source and it can get extended via
external plugins.

The package is [hosted at GitHub](http://github.com/DTJF/fb-doc) and
it contains

- the source code of the *fb-doc* tool
- the context of the documentation
- CMake scripts to build executables and documentation
- examples for extending the tool by plugins
