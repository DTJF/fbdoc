Welcome to the *@PROJ_NAME@* project. It's a cross-platform and
multifunctional tool, mainly for generating documentation from and for
FreeBASIC (= FB) source code, but useful for other purposes as well,
ie. like generating header files. Rather than creating the
documentation output directly, *@PROJ_NAME@* is designed to close the
gap between FB and C syntax to allow for using any C / C++
documentation tool-chain. Also it supports generating documentational
comments in the source. And it can get extended via external plugins.

The package is [hosted at GitHub](@PROJ_WEBS@) and
it contains

- the source code of the *@PROJ_NAME@* tool
- the context of the documentation
- CMake scripts to build executables and documentation
- examples for extending the tool by plugins
